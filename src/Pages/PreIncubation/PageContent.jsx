        content: "The 'Forge' pre-incubation programme of IEDC MEC concentrates on the ideation and prototype development. The student(s) selected for Forge will be provided with mentorship and guidance from industry experts consisting of XMECian entrepreneurs, MBA graduates and other industry leaders. The duration of this programme will be between approximately 5 - 8 months. Forge would facilitate the cohort to develop their ideas into a proof of concept and scale them into an MVP with a thorough understanding of the technical feasibility, market and the revenue streams. During the pre-incubation period, the cohort will have to provide status reports of their projects to the mentors and the IEDC MEC Pre-Incubation team, take note of the feedback provided and improve the product in the subsequent iterations. At the end of the pre-incubation phase the cohort is expected to develop a Minimum Viable Product with a thorough market knowledge. If the aforementioned outcomes are satisfied, incubation at Kerala Startup Mission may be facilitated through an affiliation partnership with KUM."
